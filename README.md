# Covid-19-analysis-and-prediction
This is an ML project in which I used machine learning techniques to predict whether patients are infected by the COVID-19 virus based on symptoms defined by the WHO. The code can be run in Google Colab, Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook), and other compatible environments.
The languages used are ML and python.
